# Analysis of Spotify all time history with R

Download your Spotify extended streaming history and take a look at your favorite songs, albums etc.
Get started with `wrapped.R`

You can also directly upload your JSON-files and get an overview here: <https://lebot.shinyapps.io/spotify/>

If you want to analyze even further, you can set up access to the Spotify Web API with your account at <https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api>
You can then use the function `add_api_data.R`
